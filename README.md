# Magical Christmas Land
The world I want to live in ith this is as follows:  

On Sunday I want to open something that has the default games, start times, and announcement blurb with the upcoming D-SHT number  
I'm able to change the games/schedule if needed and add in edition blurb along with potentially any info at the end  

I press a lil' "Run weekly" and the folowing happens:  
A Discord announcement is made with the information, the annoucement contains reactions for each game  
If enough people react, a challonge bracket for that game is made and those people are added to it  
Challonge brackets are automatically seeded using Braacket
The twitch information is updated for the weekly  

During the weekly it would then be nice to have a little app on mobile that can update the stream and challonge info real-time along with scores but that sounds hard and annoying so w/e, that can be a bonus

After brackets are done, I hit an "End weekly" button that does the following:  
The Challonge brackets are ended, or show up with a request to finish them (oops)
The Twitch stream is ended and the VODs are uploaded to youtube  
the bracket info from Challonge is uploaded to Braacket and ladder is updated  
A results banner is generated for the top 3 of the games run  
That results banner is posted to Discord
