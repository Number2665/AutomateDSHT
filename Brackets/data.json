JSON doesn't support comments but sue me
In theory this is where I'm going to store stuff
I think this can store my D-SHT game template along with the D-SHT number
I should probably keep the challonge template out of here, but maybe it ends up in here too because it'll be pretty empty otherwise

JSON time formatting?: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
(Year-Month-Day TimeHours:Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds Timezone)

{
  "currentDSHT": "194"
  "events": {
    "firstGame": "Ultimate",
    "firstTime": "",
    "secondGame": "P+",
    "secondTime": "",
    "thirdGame": "HDR",
    "thirdTime": "",
  }
}
